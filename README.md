# ⚖️ Bangladesh Legal RAG Assistant

> A domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers questions about Bangladeshi law using official government legal texts — built end-to-end with hybrid search, reranking, and systematic LLM-based evaluation.

## 🧠 What it does

Ask natural-language questions about Bangladeshi law — **Right to Information, Labour Rights, Consumer Protection, Anti-Corruption, Income Tax, Births and Deaths Registration, and Citizenship Act** — and get grounded, source-cited answers pulled directly from the official acts, not from the LLM's general knowledge.

If the answer isn't in the source documents, the system says so instead of guessing — verified during evaluation with out-of-domain test questions.

**Example:**
> **Q:** What is the maternity benefit period for women workers?
> **A:** 8 weeks preceding delivery and 8 weeks following delivery, totaling 16 weeks.
> **📄 Source:** `labour-act-2006.pdf`

## 📚 Data Sources

7 official Bangladeshi acts, sourced from [bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd](http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd) and other official sources:

- Right to Information Act, 2009
- Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006
- Consumers' Right Protection Act, 2009
- Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004
- Income Tax Act, 2023
- Births and Deaths Registration Act, 2004
- Citizenship Act, 1951

## 📊 Evaluation Results

Evaluated on a 16-question test set spanning all 5 legal domains plus an out-of-domain guardrail check, using an LLM-as-judge approach (Groq scoring faithfulness and relevance on a 1-5 scale):

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| **Faithfulness** | 4.88 / 5 |
| **Relevance** | 4.25 / 5 |

Full breakdown in [`eval_results.json`](./eval_results.json).

**Note on structure-aware chunking:** switching from fixed-size to legal-section-boundary chunking improved faithfulness (4.75 → 4.88) — answers are more consistently grounded in complete, well-formed legal sections rather than arbitrary text windows. However, relevance saw a slight dip (4.56 → 4.25), likely because long sections that get sub-chunked can separate a section's identifying opening text from its later detail, occasionally causing the most relevant fragment to rank lower. This is a real tradeoff of structure-aware chunking, not an unambiguous improvement.

### Known limitations

1. **Paraphrase gap:** Retrieval occasionally underranks the correct chunk when query phrasing diverges from source terminology, even when the chunk itself is clean and well-formed. Confirmed via structure-aware chunking (splitting by legal section boundaries): the RTI Act's complaint procedure (Section 25) exists as a complete, well-structured chunk in the vector store, but still scores below the top-5 threshold for "file a complaint" vs. the source's "lodge a complaint." This isolates the issue to the embedding/reranking model's semantic sensitivity, not chunk quality.

2. **Cross-document keyword collision:** Asking about a product "refund" can surface Income Tax Act chunks (which discuss tax refunds) alongside relevant Consumer Rights Act chunks, since BM25 matches the literal word regardless of legal context. A document-classification approach (boosting chunks from the most semantically likely document) was tested and successfully fixed this specific case, but measurably reduced overall answer relevance (4.56 → 4.06 across the evaluation set) by over-promoting less-relevant chunks within the "boosted" document. This was reverted after evaluation — a useful finding that a targeted fix for one failure mode can regress others, and that fixed-strength heuristic boosts are risky without more careful tuning or a held-out validation set.

Both limitations point to the same underlying tradeoff: the free, local embedding/reranker models used here (chosen for zero-cost deployment) are less robust to phrasing variation and cross-domain ambiguity than larger paid models would be.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Expand document coverage to more citizen-service laws
- Experiment with paid embedding models to address the known retrieval limitation
- Add conversation memory for multi-turn follow-up questions
- Add automated regression tests for retrieval quality
